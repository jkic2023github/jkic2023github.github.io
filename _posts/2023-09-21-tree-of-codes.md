When houses are overpriced and mortgage rates are high, consider these strategies: 

1. **Patience Pays Off:** Be patient and wait for a better market.  Overpriced homes and high mortgage rates can be temporary.  Keep an eye on the market trends and be ready to strike when conditions are more favorable.

2. **Negotiate:** Don't hesitate to negotiate with sellers.  They might be willing to lower their asking price or provide concessions to close the deal. 

3. **Expand Your Search:** Look in different neighborhoods or consider homes that need some renovation.  Sometimes, you can find hidden gems in less popular areas or properties that need a little TLC.

4. **Improve Your Credit:** Work on improving your credit score to qualify for better mortgage rates.  A higher credit score can lead to lower interest rates, which can save you a significant amount over the life of your loan.

5. **Increase Your Down Payment:** If possible, save for a larger down payment.  A bigger down payment can help you qualify for a smaller loan and potentially better rates.

6. **Explore Other Loan Options:** Investigate various mortgage programs, such as FHA loans or VA loans, which may offer more favorable terms or lower down payment requirements.

7. **Consult a Mortgage Advisor:** Speak with a mortgage advisor (like me) who can provide guidance on navigating the current market conditions and help you find the best mortgage options available.

8. **Consider Renting:** Sometimes, it makes sense to continue renting while you wait for more favorable conditions.  This allows you to save money and be in a better position when the housing market or mortgage rates improve.

Remember that real estate markets are cyclical, and conditions can change.  It's essential to make informed decisions based on your financial situation and long-term goals.
